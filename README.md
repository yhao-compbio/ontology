# This repository collects and processes pathway ontology data. 

Detailed documentation about the source dataset can be found [here](downloads/README.md). Detailed documentation about the code can be found [here](src/README.md). Detailed documentation about the generated dataset can be found [here](data/README.md). Below are some basic summary statistics of the source datasets.
