## Using structure-target connections and gene-pathway relationships from Reactome to generate data files for constructing DTox hierarchy

+ [`feature/`](feature/) contains lists of features that comprise the input layer (layer 0) of DTox hierarchy. Two types of features were included in the folder: i) [MACSS fingerprints](feature/maccs_fingerprints.txt) and ii) [predicted target binding profile](feature/target_profile_from_maccs_fingerprints.txt)

+ [`reactome/root/`](reactome/root/) contains processed root Reactome pathway files for constructing DTox hierarchy. [The mapping file](reactome/root/root_file_map.tsv) provides between the names of root pathway files and root pathway names/IDs. 

+ [`reactome/hierarchy/`](reactome/hierarchy/) contains processed Reactome data files for constructing DTox hierarchy. Name of each file represents the parameters employed to generate the dathe hierarchy
  + 'rt': root pathway(s) included in the hierarchy (see [the mapping file](reactome/root/root_file_map.tsv) above for name mapping).  
  + 'ps': minimal size of pathway included in the hierarchy (values: 5, 10, 20)
  + 're': whether to include Reactome reaction in the hierarchy (1: True; 0: False)
  + 'st': whether structure features are the input layer of hierarchy (1: True; 0: False)
  + end of name demonstrates file type
    + node layer file (files that end with 'layer.tsv')
    + node number file (files that end with 'node.tsv')
    + node connection file by structure/gene/pathway node name (files that end with 'knowledge_by_name.tsv')
    + node connection file by node number (files that end with 'knowledge_by_node.tsv')
    + pathway node size file (files that end with 'node_size.tsv')
    + root node name file (files that end with 'root.tsv')

+ [`reactome/hierarchy_shuffle/`](reactome/hierarchy_shuffle/) contains processed node connection file that represents shuffled DTox hierarchy while preserving the distribution of connections between node layers.
